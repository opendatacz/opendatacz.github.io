<p class="flow-text">
Components can have descriptions now.
This means that besides their label which you can change, you can add more text describing the component further, distinguishing it from others on the pipeline.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col s12 m7 l6">
        
    </div>
    <div class="col s12 m5 l6">
        <p class="flow-text">
            The description can have mulitple lines.
            A typical use case for custom descriptions is distinguishing query components in pipelines, where they are many.
