Since October 1st, 2013 we cooperate with our colleagues from Slovakia, Italy and Netherlands on a research project <a href="http://www.comsode.eu">COMSODE</a> financed by the European Union. 
The goal of the project is to develop software components and methodologies which will make publication and consumption of open data easier. 
Within the project we will cooperate with several institutions in EU countries and we will publish their data as open. 
We will try to cleanse and link the data so that their exploitation is as easy as possible. 
The project has started recently, news will appear at the <a href="http://www.comsode.eu">project web site</a>.
