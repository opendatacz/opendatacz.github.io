<p>
Topics include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>On dataset priorities</li>
<ul>
<li>What are the key criteria for prioritising datasets for publication?</li>
<li>How can the priorities of the producers and the users be balanced when selecting datasets for publication?</li>
<li>Should producers of the same category (e.g. municipalities or local governments) publish a common set of datasets (e.g. budgetary data, public transport data etc.)? If yes, how should this common set of dataset should be identified and how can these datasets be provided in a coherent and interoperable manner?</li>
<li>Should the potential for reuse, both for commercial and non-commercial purposes, play a role in the section process? If so, how can this potential be measured and/or evaluated?</li>
<li>How do you create synergies and avoid redundant efforts when establishing and maintaining an overview/inventory of the data in the organisation? And how is this coordinated across different teams working on, for instance, open data, information security, archiving, performance reporting, knowledge management etc.</li>
</ul>
<li>On engagement</li>
<ul>
<li>How can public bodies engage the potential reusers of their data?</li>
<li>What methods are available to reusers of your data to send you feedback about your data?</li>
<li>How do you handle feedback received so as to improve your data?</li>
<li>Should data producers track use of, and demand for, data? If so, how?</li>
<li>How does data visualisation foster participation in political and social life, and increase transparency of government?</li>
</ul>
<li>Related Questions</li>
<ul>
<li>How can/should public authorities respond to community efforts to crowd source data that replicates official data that is not open? (e.g. address data)</li>
<li>What could be the role of standard disclaimers or positive statements (sometimes known as 'proclaimers') to communicate the extent to which data can be guaranteed to be complete?</li>
<li>What quality aspects need to be considered for different types of data?</li>
<li>What are the challenges and possible solutions for the persistent maintenance of data over time?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Alongside the presentations this workshop will offer a lot of opportunities for discussion within a small groups meeting to discuss particular themes. There are several ways in which you can participate:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead a session – the session proposal (1 or 2 pages in length) should describe the discussion you would like to lead and the experiences you have to offer.</li>
<li>Give a plenary talk – a position paper up to 5 pages summarizing your talk is expected.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to lead a session or give a plenary talk, you can still attend the workshop. In such case indicate your interest in the topic in a short position paper. The intention is to make sure that participants have an active interest in the area, and that the workshop will benefit from their presence.</li>
</ul>

Share-PSI 2.0 is the European network for the exchange of experience and ideas around implementing open data policies in the public sector. It brings together government departments, standards bodies, academic institutions, commercial organisations, trade associations and interest groups to identify what does and doesn't work, what is and isn't practical, what can and can't be expected of different stakeholders. The impetus for the Share PSI 2.0 Thematic Network is the revised European Directive on the Public Sector Information. The main activity of the network is to organise a series of workshops examining different aspects of PSI. In each workshop, the network partners with direct experience will present their case studies. The output of the workshops will be offered as input to the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/">Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group</a>.
</p>
<p>
Share-PSI 2.0 is co-funded by the European Commission under theICT Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme; Agreement no. 621012.
