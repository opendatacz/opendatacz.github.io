Share-PSI 2.0 is the European network for the exchange of experience and ideas around implementing open data policies in the public sector. It brings together government departments, standards bodies, academic institutions, commercial organisations, trade associations and interest groups to identify what does and doesn't work, what is and isn't practical, what can and can't be expected of different stakeholders. The impetus for the Share PSI 2.0 Thematic Network is the revised European Directive on the Public Sector Information. The main activity of the network is to organise a series of workshops examining different aspects of PSI. In each workshop, the network partners with direct experience will present their case studies. The output of the workshops will be offered as input to the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/">Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group</a>.
</p>
<p>
Share-PSI 2.0 is co-funded by the European Commission under the ICT Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme; Agreement no. 621012.
