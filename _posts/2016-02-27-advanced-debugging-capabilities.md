We have greatly improved the debugging capabilities.
Now we have a graphical overview of how the execution went.
When your pipeline fails, you can simply fix what was wrong and resume from the point of failure.
And when you are developing your query and need to rerun it over an over again until it is perfect, you can do that now too.
Check out the debugging support description.
